# SimpleMention

SimpleMention is a professional, high-performance Minecraft plugin designed for modern server environments including **Paper, Leaf, and Folia** (1.21.1+). It enhances player interaction by providing smart chat mentions with visual highlighting and sound notifications.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Smart Highlighting**: Automatically detects player names in chat and applies professional formatting:
  - **Color**: Gold (`§6`)
  - **Style**: Underlined (`§n`)
  - **Symbol**: Prefixed with `@`
- **🔡 Case-Insensitive Matching**: Mention players regardless of how you type their name (e.g., typing `yoursenior` will correctly highlight `YourSenior`).
- **✅ Official Auto-Correction**: Always displays the mentioned player's official in-game capitalization in chat, no matter how it was typed by the sender.
- **🛡️ Word Boundary Protection**: Prevents accidental pings. It only triggers on exact name matches, so typing `YourSeniorn` will not ping `YourSenior`.
- **🔊 High-Quality Notifications**: Plays the distinct `ENTITY_EXPERIENCE_ORB_PICKUP` sound to mentioned players.
- **🔒 Privacy & Control**:
  - **Global Toggle**: Players can disable all mention sounds for themselves.
  - **Block List**: Players can block specific users from ever triggering a ping sound for them.
- **⚙️ Folia Optimized**: Built using thread-safe scheduling to work perfectly on regionalized/multi-threaded servers.
